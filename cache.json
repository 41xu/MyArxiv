The hierarchical organizational structure\nenables one to eliminate the vast majority of triangles that do not help find\nthe closest point. In this paper, we develop a totally different algorithmic\nparadigm, named P2M, to speed up point-to-mesh distance queries. Our original\nintention is to precompute a KD tree (KDT) of mesh vertices to approximately\nencode the geometry of a mesh surface containing vertices, edges and faces.\nHowever, it is very likely that the closest primitive to the query point is an\nedge e (resp., a face f), but the KDT reports a mesh vertex \\u{psion} instead.\nWe call \\u{psion} an interceptor of e (resp., f). The main contribution of this\npaper is to invent a simple yet effective interception inspection rule and an\nefficient flooding interception inspection algorithm for quickly finding out\nall the interception pairs. Once the KDT and the interception table are\nprecomputed, the query stage proceeds by first searching the KDT and then\nlooking up the interception table to retrieve the closest geometric primitive.\nStatistics show that our query algorithm runs many times faster than the\nstate-of-the-art solvers.\n","authors":["Chen Zong","Jiacheng Xu","Jiantao Song","Shuangmin Chen","Shiqing Xin","Wenping Wang","Changhe Tu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16084v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15920v1","updated":"2023-08-30T09:53:35Z","published":"2023-08-30T09:53:35Z","title":"Saving temporary exhibitions in virtual environments: the Digital\n  Renaissance of Ulisse Aldrovandi","summary":"  Our goal was to obtain the digital twin of the temporary exhibition \"The\nOther Renaissance: Ulisse Aldrovandi and the Wonders of the World\", to make it\naccessible online to users using various devices (from smartphones to VR\nheadsets).

At the core of our\napproach lies a novel hand-object contact representation called RUPs (Region\nUnwrapping Profiles), which unwrap the roughly estimated hand-object surfaces\nas multiple high-resolution 2D regional profiles. The region grouping strategy\nis consistent with the hand kinematic bone division because they are the\nprimitive initiators for a composite contact pattern. Based on this\nrepresentation, our Regional Unwrapping Transformer (RUFormer) learns the\ncorrelation priors across regions from monocular inputs and predicts\ncorresponding contact and deformed transformations. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed framework can robustly estimate the deformed degrees and\ndeformed transformations, which makes it suitable for both nonrigid and rigid\ncontact.\n","authors":["Wei Xie","Zimeng Zhao","Shiying Li","Binghui Zuo","Yangang Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14074v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted by ICCV2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15016v2","updated":"2023-08-30T13:33:59Z","published":"2023-07-27T17:19:32Z","title":"How Good is Google Bard's Visual Understanding?

Stage-1 involves applying DWT and retaining the\nLow-Low (LL) subband images for image enhancement. In Stage-2, the original\ninput image is divided into four single-channel images (Red, Green, Blue, and\nGray), and each is trained with independent adversarial networks to extract\ncolor foreground information. In Stage-3, the output image from Stage-2 and the\noriginal input image are used to train independent adversarial networks for\ndocument binarization, enabling the integration of global and local features.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other\nclassic and state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the Document Image Binarization\nContest (DIBCO) datasets.

The most commonly used approaches\nto detecting changes in point clouds are based on supervised methods which\nnecessitate extensive labelled data often unavailable in real-world\napplications. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised approach that\ncomprises two components: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) for continuous\nshape reconstruction and a Gaussian Mixture Model for categorising changes. INR\noffers a grid-agnostic representation for encoding bi-temporal point clouds,\nwith unmatched spatial support that can be regularised to enhance\nhigh-frequency details and reduce noise.

Slice thickness of CT images may vary by clinical\nindication. For example, thinner slices are used for presurgical planning when\nfine anatomic details of small vessels are required. While keeping the\neffective radiation dose in patients as low as possible, various slice\nthicknesses are employed in CRLMs due to their limitations.

This study empirically investigates the latter and expands the\nunderstanding of frequency shortcuts. First, we perform experiments on\nsynthetic datasets, designed to have a bias in different frequency bands. Our\nresults demonstrate that NNs tend to find simple solutions for classification,\nand what they learn first during training depends on the most distinctive\nfrequency characteristics, which can be either low- or high-frequencies.\nSecond, we confirm this phenomenon on natural images.

However, the interpretability of these methods remains an\nunresolved issue. Furthermore, these approaches currently face acceleration\nlimitations that are comparable to those experienced by image-domain methods.\nIn order to enhance interpretability and overcome the acceleration limitations,\nthis paper introduces an interpretable framework that unifies both $k$-space\ninterpolation techniques and image-domain methods, grounded in the physical\nprinciples of heat diffusion equations. Building upon this foundational\nframework, a novel $k$-space interpolation method is proposed. Specifically, we\nmodel the process of high-frequency information attenuation in $k$-space as a\nheat diffusion equation, while the effort to reconstruct high-frequency\ninformation from low-frequency regions can be conceptualized as a reverse heat\nequation. However, solving the reverse heat equation poses a challenging\ninverse problem. To tackle this challenge, we modify the heat equation to align\nwith the principles of magnetic resonance PI physics and employ the score-based\ngenerative method to precisely execute the modified reverse heat diffusion.\nFinally, experimental validation conducted on publicly available datasets\ndemonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach over traditional\n$k$-space interpolation methods, deep learning-based $k$-space interpolation\nmethods, and conventional diffusion models in terms of reconstruction accuracy,\nparticularly in high-frequency regions.\n","authors":["Zhuo-Xu Cui","Congcong Liu","Xiaohong Fan","Chentao Cao","Jing Cheng","Qingyong Zhu","Yuanyuan Liu","Sen Jia","Yihang Zhou","Haifeng Wang","Yanjie Zhu","Jianping Zhang","Qiegen Liu","Dong Liang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15918v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14027v2","updated":"2023-08-30T09:26:11Z","published":"2023-03-24T14:37:07Z","title":"PoincarÃ© ResNet","summary":"  This paper introduces an end-to-end residual network that operates entirely\non the Poincar\\'e ball model of hyperbolic space.

To defend AEs, adversarial training (AT) is\nbelieved to be the most effective method while due to the intensive\ncomputation, AT is limited to be applied in most applications. In this paper,\nto resolve the problem, we design a generic and efficient AT improvement\nscheme, namely case-aware adversarial training (CAT). Specifically, the\nintuition stems from the fact that a very limited part of informative samples\ncan contribute to most of model performance. Alternatively, if only the most\ninformative AEs are used in AT, we can lower the computation complexity of AT\nsignificantly as maintaining the defense effect. To achieve this, CAT achieves\ntwo breakthroughs. First, a method to estimate the information degree of\nadversarial examples is proposed for AE filtering. Second, to further enrich\nthe information that the NN can obtain from AEs, CAT involves a weight\nestimation and class-level balancing based sampling strategy to increase the\ndiversity of AT at each iteration.

A Case Study on\n  Global Magnitude Pruning","summary":"  Pruning neural networks has become popular in the last decade when it was\nshown that a large number of weights can be safely removed from modern neural\nnetworks without compromising accuracy. Numerous pruning methods have been\nproposed since then, each claiming to be better than the previous. Many\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques today rely on complex pruning methodologies\nutilizing importance scores, getting feedback through back-propagation or\nhaving heuristics-based pruning rules amongst others. In this work, we question\nwhether this pattern of introducing complexity is really necessary to achieve\nbetter pruning results. We benchmark these SOTA techniques against a naive\npruning baseline, namely, Global Magnitude Pruning (Global MP). Global MP ranks\nweights in order of their magnitudes and prunes the smallest ones. Hence, in\nits vanilla form, it is one of the simplest pruning techniques. Surprisingly,\nwe find that vanilla Global MP outperforms all the other SOTA techniques and\nachieves a new SOTA result. It also achieves promising performance on FLOPs\nsparsification, which we find is enhanced, when pruning is conducted in a\ngradual fashion. We also find that Global MP is generalizable across tasks,\ndatasets, and models with superior performance. Moreover, a common issue that\nmany pruning algorithms run into at high sparsity rates, namely,\nlayer-collapse, can be easily fixed in Global MP by setting a minimum threshold\nof weights to be retained in each layer. Lastly, unlike many other SOTA\ntechniques, Global MP does not require any additional algorithm specific\nhyper-parameters and is very straightforward to tune and implement.

Motivated by the finding, we construct a large-scale\ndataset, Natural Denoising Diffusion Attack (NDDA) dataset, to systematically\nevaluate the risk of the natural attack capability of diffusion models with\nstate-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models. We evaluate the natural attack\ncapability by answering 6 research questions. Through a user study to confirm\nthe validity of the NDD attack, we find that the NDD attack can achieve an 88%\ndetection rate while being stealthy to 93% of human subjects. We also find that\nthe non-robust features embedded by diffusion models contribute to the natural\nattack capability. To confirm the model-agnostic and transferrable attack\ncapability, we perform the NDD attack against an AD vehicle and find that 73%\nof the physically printed attacks can be detected as a stop sign. We hope that\nour study and dataset can help our community to be aware of the risk of\ndiffusion models and facilitate further research toward robust DNN models.\n","authors":["Takami Sato","Justin Yue","Nanze Chen","Ningfei Wang","Qi Alfred Chen"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15692v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15690v1","updated":"2023-08-30T01:14:32Z","published":"2023-08-30T01:14:32Z","title":"CongNaMul: A Dataset for Advanced Image Processing of Soybean Sprouts","summary":"  We present 'CongNaMul', a comprehensive dataset designed for various tasks in\nsoybean sprouts image analysis.

However,\non-the-fly computation slows down algorithms and results in a negative impact\non the time performance. To address this issue, we propose a new task-parallel\napproach to proactively compute mesh connectivity.

However, reconstructing smooth and detailed\nsurfaces in indoor scenes from multi-view images presents unique challenges.\nIndoor scenes typically contain large texture-less regions, making the\nphotometric loss unreliable for optimizing the implicit surface. Previous work\nutilizes monocular geometry priors to improve the reconstruction in indoor\nscenes. However, monocular priors often contain substantial errors in thin\nstructure regions due to domain gaps and the inherent inconsistencies when\nderived independently from different views. This paper presents \\textbf{DebSDF}\nto address these challenges, focusing on the utilization of uncertainty in\nmonocular priors and the bias in SDF-based volume rendering.

Existing approaches typically rely on convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) to learn the content of urban scenes.\n  In this paper, we propose a Content-enhanced Mask TransFormer (CMFormer) for\ndomain-generalized USSS. The main idea is to enhance the focus of the\nfundamental component, the mask attention mechanism, in Transformer\nsegmentation models on content information. To achieve this, we introduce a\nnovel content-enhanced mask attention mechanism. It learns mask queries from\nboth the image feature and its down-sampled counterpart, as lower-resolution\nimage features usually contain more robust content information and are less\nsensitive to style variations. These features are fused into a Transformer\ndecoder and integrated into a multi-resolution content-enhanced mask attention\nlearning scheme.\n  Extensive experiments conducted on various domain-generalized urban-scene\nsegmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed CMFormer significantly\noutperforms existing CNN-based methods for domain-generalized semantic\nsegmentation, achieving improvements of up to 14.00\\% in terms of mIoU (mean\nintersection over union).

Enhancing the robustness of\nobject detection models is of utmost importance, especially for those designed\nfor aerial images, which feature complex backgrounds, substantial variations in\nscales and orientations of objects. This paper addresses the challenge of\nassessing the robustness of object detection models in aerial images, with a\nspecific emphasis on scenarios where images are affected by clouds. In this\nstudy, we introduce two novel benchmarks based on DOTA-v1.0.

For visual inspection, the deteriorated class acquired from the\nsurface of concrete and steel components are occasionally imbalanced. From\nnumerous related surveys, we conclude that imbalanced data problems can be\ncategorised into four types: 1) missing range of target and label valuables, 2)\nmajority-minority class imbalance, 3) foreground background of spatial\nimbalance, and 4) long-tailed class of pixel-wise imbalance. Since 2015, many\nimbalanced studies have been conducted using deep-learning approaches,\nincluding regression, image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation.

Recent\ngenerative model techniques have shown promising progress to address such\nchallenges by learning 3D assets using only plentiful 2D images -- but still\nsuffer limitations as they leverage either human-curated image datasets or\nrenderings from manually-created synthetic 3D environments.

In addition, collecting large-scale,\nhigh-quality datasets with paired egocentric videos and 3D human motions\nrequires accurate motion capture devices, which often limit the variety of\nscenes in the videos to lab-like environments. To eliminate the need for paired\negocentric video and human motions, we propose a new method, Ego-Body Pose\nEstimation via Ego-Head Pose Estimation (EgoEgo), which decomposes the problem\ninto two stages, connected by the head motion as an intermediate\nrepresentation. EgoEgo first integrates SLAM and a learning approach to\nestimate accurate head motion.

However, most of them are based on deep convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) or generative adversarial networks (GANs) and the scale factor\nneeds to be determined before constructing the network. As a result, a single\ntraining session only supports a fixed factor and has poor generalization\nability. To address these problems, this paper proposes a Feature-Enhanced\nImplicit Neural Representation (FFEINR) for spatio-temporal super-resolution of\nflow field data. It can take full advantage of the implicit neural\nrepresentation in terms of model structure and sampling resolution. The neural\nrepresentation is based on a fully connected network with periodic activation\nfunctions, which enables us to obtain lightweight models. The learned\ncontinuous representation can decode the low-resolution flow field input data\nto arbitrary spatial and temporal resolutions, allowing for flexible\nupsampling. The training process of FFEINR is facilitated by introducing\nfeature enhancements for the input layer, which complements the contextual\ninformation of the flow field. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod, a series of experiments are conducted on different datasets by setting\ndifferent hyperparameters.

However, the majority of existing research designs graph\npooling operators only from the perspective of nodes while disregarding the\noriginal edge features, in a way that not only confines graph pooling\napplication scenarios, but also diminishes its ability to capture critical\nsubstructures. In this study, a clustering graph pooling method that first\nsupports multidimensional edge features, called Edge-aware hard clustering\ngraph pooling (EHCPool), is developed. EHCPool proposes the first\n'Edge-to-node' score evaluation criterion based on edge features to assess node\nfeature significance. To more effectively capture the critical subgraphs, a\nnovel Iteration n-top strategy is further designed to adaptively learn sparse\nhard clustering assignments for graphs. Subsequently, an innovative N-E\nAggregation strategy is presented to aggregate node and edge feature\ninformation in each independent subgraph. The proposed model was evaluated on\nmulti-site brain imaging public datasets and yielded state-of-the-art\nperformance.

Our approach utilizes a mixture-of-experts neural network\nmodel, in which the phases cluster movements in both space and time with\ndifferent expert weights. Each generated set of weights then produces a\nsequence of poses in an autoregressive manner between the current and target\nstate of the character. In addition, to satisfy poses which are manually\nmodified by the animators or where certain end effectors serve as constraints\nto be reached by the animation, a learned bi-directional control scheme is\nimplemented to satisfy such constraints. The results demonstrate that using\nphases for motion in-betweening tasks sharpen the interpolated movements, and\nfurthermore stabilizes the learning process. Moreover, using phases for motion\nin-betweening tasks can also synthesize more challenging movements beyond\nlocomotion behaviors. Additionally, style control is enabled between given\ntarget keyframes. Our proposed framework can compete with popular\nstate-of-the-art methods for motion in-betweening in terms of motion quality\nand generalization, especially in the existence of long transition durations.\nOur framework contributes to faster prototyping workflows for creating animated\ncharacter sequences, which is of enormous interest for the game and film\nindustry.\n","authors":["Paul Starke","Sebastian Starke","Taku Komura","Frank Steinicke"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.12751v1.pdf","comment":"17 pages, 11 figures, conference"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00391v2","updated":"2023-08-24T11:17:37Z","published":"2023-04-30T05:25:39Z","title":"Alternately denoising and reconstructing unoriented point sets","summary":"  We propose a new strategy to bridge point cloud denoising and surface\nreconstruction by alternately updating the denoised point clouds and the\nreconstructed surfaces. In Poisson surface reconstruction, the implicit\nfunction is generated by a set of smooth basis functions centered at the\noctnodes. When the octree depth is properly selected, the reconstructed surface\nis a good smooth approximation of the noisy point set. Our method projects the\nnoisy points onto the surface and alternately reconstructs and projects the\npoint set. We use the iterative Poisson surface reconstruction (iPSR) to\nsupport unoriented surface reconstruction. Our method iteratively performs iPSR\nand acts as an outer loop of iPSR.

The studies\nfocused on three aspects: 1) the human-likeness of the motion, 2) the\nappropriateness of the motion for the agent's own speech whilst controlling for\nthe human-likeness of the motion, and 3) the appropriateness of the motion for\nthe behaviour of the interlocutor in the interaction, using a setup that\ncontrols for both the human-likeness of the motion and the agent's own speech.\nWe found a large span in human-likeness between challenge submissions, with a\nfew systems rated close to human mocap.

In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel multi-dancer synthesis task called partner dancer generation, which\ninvolves synthesizing virtual human dancers capable of performing dance with\nusers. The task aims to control the pose diversity between the lead dancer and\nthe partner dancer. The core of this task is to ensure the controllable\ndiversity of the generated partner dancer while maintaining temporal\ncoordination with the lead dancer. This scenario varies from earlier research\nin generating dance motions driven by music, as our emphasis is on\nautomatically designing partner dancer postures according to pre-defined\ndiversity, the pose of lead dancer, as well as the accompanying tunes. To\nachieve this objective, we propose a three-stage framework called\nDance-with-You (DanY). Initially, we employ a 3D Pose Collection stage to\ncollect a wide range of basic dance poses as references for motion generation.\nThen, we introduce a hyper-parameter that coordinates the similarity between\ndancers by masking poses to prevent the generation of sequences that are\nover-diverse or consistent. To avoid the rigidity of movements, we design a\nDance Pre-generated stage to pre-generate these masked poses instead of filling\nthem with zeros. After that, a Dance Motion Transfer stage is adopted with\nleader sequences and music, in which a multi-conditional sampling formula is\nrewritten to transfer the pre-generated poses into a sequence with a partner\nstyle. In practice, to address the lack of multi-person datasets, we introduce\nAIST-M, a new dataset for partner dancer generation, which is publicly\navailiable.
